"One of the things that's really frustrating about this election is that Democratic internal polling is clearly telling them very different things than what we're seeing--but we're not seeing that, either, and we don't know where it's wrong. I find this election frustrating not so much because it's a guaranteed loss (it isn't), but because I don't know how to predict it or read a lot of the information we're getting.Biden's going to FL. Not PA, not GA, not even NV, where he did pretty well. FL, where he was four points down.Now, that could be a complete fuck-up on their part. I don't have the data. But generally, you don't send someone to a state you're guaranteed to lose. What information made them choose to go there? Was it wrong?

"[Quit reading doom takes and spam polls and just follow Simon Rosenberg. I've been reading the same data he has, and he's very right about how the early vote is shaping. He posts daily updates about it too, and it points to a much better chance of the Dems doing well than the media is ever likely to admit.](https://twitter.com/SimonWDC/status/1587410321169317891)He's also correctly calling out how much of the R shift is due to outright manipulative polling. Some of us have been pointing this out for weeks, but it's good to see more of the credible pundits figuring it out and looking at the hard data, and not hype.Please, people. There is a serious campaign out to discourage you from voting. You know how fascist the GOP are right now. Look at the stuff that was tried in Brazil. Do not let anyone manipulate your emotions. This board is being targeted too. Stay calm. Talk to your neighbors, volunteer with the time we have left. And vote early if you can, then help others vote too.None of the big races are unwinnable. I don't care what 538, NYTimes, or anyone named Nate says. And don't freak out about the youth vote either. Without COVID, a lot more dems showed up late in 2018 as well, so it won't be a GOP surge alone on the final day. Especially if you keep talking to voters. The older voters who are showing up so far are also voting more blue than in the past. Even the white ones.

"We need to work on encouraging younger voters to vote early if their state has early in-person voting. Assuming many are just waiting until election day, there is a chance something happens that makes it difficult or not possible at all to vote on that day or they temporarily talk themselves out of it, but they and we all have to live with the consequences of that for the next 2 to 6 years (senate seats). Also, we need to start pushing back on the tired excuses given (and regardless of age) while they act superior about it. ""Oh, must be nice to be privileged enough to vote, the rest of us have to work 24/7 with no days off and don't know how to use the mail."" Most states now allow early voting, both in person and by mail. Early voting was fought for as a response to the issue of not everyone having time to vote on 1 week day and it not being a federal holiday (and many people still work on federal holidays anyway so that isn't the magic solution some try to act like it is). This argument for not voting is mostly outdated, as there are now only [5 states left](https://img.overdriveonline.com/files/base/randallreilly/all/image/2022/09/voting.63177bca5e650.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=700) that do not have early voting options, half of those lean Democratic.And the demographic of voters most targeted by Republicans (black voters) are turning out in higher percents so far compared to the equivalent time before election day in 2020 and 2018.

"A few notes that are worth mentioning as we head into the final stretch of campaigning:1. Don't doom, and if you do, keep it to yourself. This is very important. I get it. I spend most election weeks privately dooming. But most of the races we're talking about are within a point or two. At best, dooming does nothing. At worst, it actively harms enthusiasm for the candidates you want to win. Posting ""I'm worried about NV because..."" is fine. There's something to talk about there. Posting ""This is a bug hunt, man. The fuck we gonna do? Game over, man! Game over!"" is actively unhelpful.2. Refer to one.3. We probably shouldn't expect most of the important results on election night, unless it's a blowout one way or the other (which the polls are not indicating basically at all). The House will probably be decided first night, but GA, PA, AZ, etc. haven't really made improvements on ballot-counting. Mirages either way are possible depending on the state; some races (Shapiro, for instance) will be decided pretty quickly. Some will not.4. See one.5. It's worth spending some time cooling off. If you need to take a mental health break, do it. Enjoy Halloween, bake something--do what you need to do to calm down.6. Frankly, a lot of these races are still winnable, which given the surrounding context is actually pretty remarkable. Good luck to all Democratic candidates.",0.29128048,0

"Reminder that it's been a cycle for at least the past hundred years that when a party regains the White House, the opposing party regains the House of Representatives in the following midterm.This is most likely due to the twin factors of the party that regained the White House being complacent, and the party that lost it being fired up.It's always been the Republican's odds that they would regain the House of Representatives this year. The fact that it's even close shows how unpopular they are.It remains hopeful that the GOP might not regain the house, and that's what I'm for.

Yet oil was at about $116/barrel and coming down. For comparison, US highest ever oil price was $140 per barrel in June of 2008, and gas was $4.11/gallon.Right now, for the price of a barrel of oil, you could get 22.4 gallons of regular gasoline. In June, you could get about 23.2 gallons. In March, oil's highest this year, you could get *27.6* gallons of gas for the price of an oil barrel.

And once the spread started, Trump's reckless disregard for public health experts, failure to lay out clear, consistent federal guidelines, and unwillingness to surge resources for protective equipment and critical health services created widespread confusion and chaos that state and local officials had to deal with. Millions died as a result.3. Lockdowns at the state and local level were focused on providing guidance for *voluntary* social distancing and placing restrictions on businesses. No constitutional rights were violated. The government has a constitutional power to regulate commerce and provide for the general welfare. [Millions of lives were saved](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261759) as a result of these efforts. Further, [most Americans believe](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/09/15/majority-in-u-s-says-public-health-benefits-of-covid-19-restrictions-worth-the-costs-even-as-large-shares-also-see-downsides/) that the benefits of COVID restrictions were worth the cost, which is an important fact in a democratic system.4. Even if you disagree with state and local efforts to combat the pandemic, the impact of these efforts is far less significant than Trump's mishandling of the pandemic at a national level and undermining of public health guidance. Without a coordinated federal response and clear messaging at the federal level, any efforts by state and local officials was naturally going to be imperfect.5.

The voting numbers are also showing good signs in all the swing races early on when taken in the proper context.More to the point, we need to target GOTV initiatives correctly, and the early vote helps point to both areas of strength and weaknesses in both sides.

"My position has been relatively consistent since August. Dems 53-55 Seats around 75%. Typically I've had 53- and 54+ at 35%-65%.The strongest factor for me is actually Trafalgar polling. Cahaly typically hits the R vote share within 2% ~95-7% of the time. 90-92% for a 1% error. Specifically you average his pot-Labor Day polls. This is for 2017-2021 so roughly 5 years. I didn't check 2016. So if the Trafalgar average is ~47% that means the Dem wins. There's some leeway for independents of course, though that is mostly relevant for closer races. Basically Trafalgar puts out very R friendly polls by fiddling the D, and sometimes I, vote share and undecideds. So he'll say something like 44D-47R with 4% IND and 5% Undecided. But what actually happens is 51 D, 2 I, and 47 R.So 45-46 is a definite loss for the Republican, 47 is 85% depending on I votes, 48-49 is a ""true tossup"", 50-51 is lean/likely R and 52+ for the Reublican is essentially always a win.I am a bit worried because I told him my theory when I was asking him to poll Florida, which he still refuses to do, instead he repolled PA/AZ/NV/GA after my DM, and he also came out with a claim about ""submerged Trump voters"" which is voters even he can't reach. Whereas in previous cycles he claimed he did reach the shy Trumpers who wouldn't talk to other pollsters.But generally I'd say non-Trafalgar polling is 15%, Trafalgar is 40%, EV is 25%, and then the other 30% is anything else going on election wise. As far as why I'm pretty confident of a Dem Senate boost.I have the House at like 60/40 for Dems I guess.

"A lot.

You can also pass legislation and send it to the senate to force a vote - something I am betting the Republicans will do with a nation-wide ban on abortion and other similar policies.

The best way to handle structure problems discriminating is government paid prep schooling for any needing to raise scores needed. Public chafing at letting someone with poorer qualifications in over someone with more. Harvard actually has the other part make minimum standard the draw randomly from those that can make that standard if I understand it right. Completely fair to those discriminated against no they will have to put in at least more time and effort. But fairness the only way to crack racist ideas. This how military integrated to point racism has very little presence in promotions it made it so all under same standards and provided ability to make them. As long as people have slots because of who they are not what they have done resentment will be directed at those who got in special. At Harvard it Asians who over preform whites because of culture traditions that has them mad over preference for African Americans.Note all the problems in African American culture is caused by whites. And on occasion of demands of things from government occasionally this will be admitted. But those on left and leaders of African Americans cause great harm by denying this culture damage and working to fix them. Dislike of Education caused by white killing and oppressing educated blacks. Lack of starting business in the community meaning other ethnic groups doing it often from Muslim countries. This from white race riot killing blacks and destroying Black Wall Street and on smaller levels the same in Black areas. But this also knowledge their fellow Blacks Will loot and burn them in disasters and injustice spawned events. This shitting in your own house with the looting and burning a serious cultural problem marching to white areas far from Black ones or downtown business district if not next to the hood and burning and looting would show some heath to the culture. Plus after the King riots this gave logical reasons to red line and white flight because no matter how hard efforts to improve thing made some racist slipping thur could still cause the problem.First idea I had after recent killing was a plan to ambush and kill cops across the US in the hundreds.But then I remembered why King not just morality demanded not violence. That being white rage over black violence no matter how justified could cause the obliteration of of the African American in the US and certainly put the racists in power. And unfortunately we are now very close to this coming true the massive increase of conservative first time voters enraged over flag protests and scared by looting and burning and demand for reparations. Plus 9 percent of black men more voting for Trump. I support spending huge more money on fixing the problem but reparations were a major cause of Nazi rise to power and WWII and they had the internationally agreed only paid to living victims by countries with living causes of the need for reparations.Final reparations for Segregation meet international law standard but other black culture desire for hand out because whites leave no other option in past caused people to gain popularity and money in community for slavery reparations killing the chance for segregation reparations while those people still lived. Still maybe unwise on giving power to the racists but at least it did not have the paying for ones ancestors sins problem.International reparations law based on that principle and once you decide to have reparations over wrongs of dead people when is the cut off date and in most of the eastern hemisphere that many thousands of years of wrongs. Plus the lawyer wanting fees push to make people think money payments make anger over wrongs go away is wrong it feels nice for a short time the money spent and your still angry over the wrong done and the problems still remain.,0.026268957,0

It's completely ahistorical, and it makes sense that it's ahistorical.The problem to be remedied is that the Court is not legitimate, both in composition (the GOP stole Scalia's seat, and then, under their own, new, invented rule, stole RBG's seat as well), and in practice (it's not following its own precedents, its members aren't acting ethically vis-a-vis conflicts & recusal, and it's using the shadow docket to make substantive jurisprudence). This illegitimate Court is acting like a political arm, to protect & entrench the GOP in elected office, make it unaccountable to the electorate, and doing the GOP's dirty work so they don't need to legislatively accomplish their goals.Theoretically, the offending members could be removed, but, in practice, today's GOP will never remove a justice who decides the way they want, so, as a practical matter, the only remedy is adding & filling seats to effectively nullify the votes of the offending justices. Even then, the Court wouldn't have the legitimacy problem it currently has. The Constitution establishes a Supreme Court, but the size is unspecified, and is set legislatively. Congress can pass, and the President sign, a bill increasing the size of the Court, and it'd be perfectly legitimate. Certainly more legitimate than inventing a reason to deny an appointment to Obama, and then violating that new rule to deny an appointment to Biden.Remediation to nullify the justices making the Court illegitimate would increase the Court's legitimacy, and would also make it so the GOP couldn't rely on the illegitimate Court to hold onto power.

Gore dropped all his lawsuits and conceded the election.There's a few other important things to note. Most horrifying to me, is that the deadline passed a few hours after the Supreme Court decided the case. So the *reason* Florida missed the deadline was because the Court stopped the count four days before, against what Florida's Supreme Court called for. The deadline was also not mandatory, it is a goal that there is no consequence for missing. There was also no reason to stop the count. They could have just kept counting while the federal Supreme Court decided, and then if the Court decided it wasn't allowed, they'd just include those votes.

If you, in good faith, actually believe that all races are equal, then all races will have similar intelligence curves.

The fact that even with AA policies for diversity that White and Asians are still overrepresented means that they policies are absolutely still needed. You say qualified Asians are being denied in place of lesser qualified PoC. Considering the Asians already make up a larger portion than their demographic group that would mean either:1. You believe that the top of the Asian demographic is just so much better than the other groups that they deserve to hold even more of the positions.

"Thanks for sharing. I don't think your view is unreasonable. A little background: I'm a middle-aged white guy who is half immigrant. My Dad is American and my Mom is from the Middle East, so I have seen both sides of this story play out over the course of my life.In my view, affirmative action is about helping some people who don't necessarily look as good on paper as other people. This could be because they grew up in communities of color that have historically been disadvantaged because of racism, but there are other reasons as well. Yes, we've changed a lot of laws, but it's going to take another century before the playing field is really level if we leave it up to the courts and the politicians. But it doesn't have to be that way.You wrote: ""I think it actually demeans them it can have POC thinking they only got into a university based on their skin color"".It's not demeaning to take a chance on people. Giving people real opportunities, and taking that risk on them to follow through is what America is all about. I see it as the ultimate American ideal.America was founded with the ideals of people taking chances on other people. America was founded by people who said ""yeah, you don't necessarily look so good on paper, but we'll make room and take a chance by giving you this opportunity."" So in that sense, I think America was founded on affirmative action. My ancestors on my father's side arrived in America in the late 1700s, dirt poor from England and Germany. They left Europe and came to America seeking a better life - a life where they could own land, steer their own ship, and sail toward a destiny of their own choosing. My ancestors were by no means the cream of society, they were by no means the best or the most qualified, but they came to America and America gave them a chance. They came to America and people gave them affirmative action - chances they hadn't really earned - but were given nonetheless on strength of their character, and the charity of the people who gave them opportunities they hadn't earned.You know one thing that's really wrong with America? That people and companies hoard opportunities to dole out to the ""most qualified"" and the ""best test scores"" or the ""right social connections"" or the ""right religion"" or the ""right politics"". American companies right now hold trillions of dollars in cash and they won't even train their workers.

"Firstly. Thanks for taking the time in giving me metrics to chew through. I appreciate it.Secondly, one could argue that banning affirmative action for racial discrimination also then allows for grounds to sue again for legacy, donors, and athletic favoritism to end that. Right now, all those 3 categories are basically hiding behind the present affirmative action model. Of course, SCOTUS' has the personality of a schizophrenic, so just because it worked for one doesn't mean the other would be honored. But at least there's a path to try with some level of backing for trying vs nothing in the pocket to help out.Lastly, you're right. It did not change my mind. But this is because I disagree on principle that fighting racism with another form of racism is principally wrong. It's not a good model. Socioeconomic factors and merit should weigh more than subjective and arbitrary evaluation criteria that will change from person to person contingent to their biases, political beliefs, and life experiences, for who can and cannot be accepted to pursue higher education within the school. The former is at least something that can be reasonably derived. The latter is inherently dangerous, because imagine for a second that someone is in a bad mood and they just that decide ""well, person Y is a shit leader. Fuck them. Denied.""

"I think it was a first draft attempt at solving what was even worse racial discrimination stemming from hundreds of years of slavery and not allowing minorities at all at the whim of each individual business to act as they please. Its not perfect but nothing is not better than the something we had. It needs replaced by something better, not removed entirely. I think SCOTUS, if their intent was to truly solve racial discrimination, should have given Congress a heads up of what they might be deciding on the existing laws and given them 6mo-1yr to offer a replacement before their ruling goes into effect. I think they should have done the same with abortion as well; pretty much every decision they made this year could have been improved by roping congress in on a group email before acting. Instead they dropped the mic and overnight the country has to bend to their whim falling back decades, while obviously congress is in deadlock and is unable to act until, hopefully, the next congress is sworn in. This is proof to me that they didn't care about about the outcome, this wasn't altruism, this was purely political. They don't care whats right, they don't care how it effects the everyday American. 5 out of 9 people are making a decision that instantly effects 350 million, and a good portion of that total are effected negatively. Their beliefs about a technicality of a piece of paper are going to change the direction of millions of peoples lives in a most likely negative way. Maybe some will be positive, but any positive gain will be at the expense of someone else. Maybe the numbers will be exactly equal on both sides so no net gain or loss, but the fact that they acted at all means they changed who it effected, so that is blood on their hands.",0.00801825,0

"The “grand” is a reference to the size of a grand jury (it's bigger than a regular sized jury). It is not a reference to it being more important or high profile (even if it sounds like it).A grand jury is involved in all federal prosecutions. Their goal is to decide in secret whether the government has enough to publicly accuse someone of a crime, so that the government can't smear people at will with accusations. Let's say you're a DoJ federal prosecutor and you want to open an investigation, or think you have enough to convict someone of a crime. You can't just charge someone. Because accusing people Willy Nillyof crimes can damage their reputation. First you have to convene a grand jury, which is a a group of 20-some citizens from the general public. And then bring witnesses and evidence in front of them, and basically convince them in private that there's enough evidence to charge someone with a crime publicly.Once a grand jury agrees that the evidence is solid, it then votes to hand down an indictment (or not if the evidence is weak). THEN you (the prosecutor) publicly charge a person with a crime. Because a grand jury of their peers has determined there's enough evidence to risk harm to the persons reputation.Then they go through a regular trial. With a regular judge, jury etc (unless they come to a deal with the prosecutors).TL;DR grand juries are just secret gatherings of citizens who decide if the government has enough on someone to warrant prosecution.

The message was partially washed off by rain by the time he saw it, but in photos it appears to say “your race”—which Ringer, who is white, took to mean his campaign—and “dead.” ... In another incident within the past three weeks, Ringer came home from dinner with his girlfriend and found that someone had thrown a brick through a window and his storm door. Before October, Ringer told VICE News, he hadn't called 911 a single time since he moved in 2012 into the house where he grew up, in order to take care of his elderly parents. >“I can't connect the dots on all three incidents with my campaign,” Ringer said. “But the fact there are three incidents in the weeks leading up to the midterm election, and my neighborhood is quiet, residential, middle-class, crime-free—you know, it's like, what the hell?""",0.014728088,0

Radical leftism is relatively low wealth caps (not raw cash, wealth - including properties and investments). Radical leftism isn't equal rights for queer people. Radical leftism is not universal healthcare. Universal healthcare is common-sense, cost-saving, and benefits the entirety of the country financially as well as health-wise. The only reason it isn't done is because the rich insurance barons profit from the current system, and businesses that pay slave wages like that it's one more pressure, like the threat of homelessness and hunger, that force people to work shitty jobs for shit pay, taking power out of the workers hands and letting them get away with egregious abuses.",0.10200156,0

As long as it's dated by Election Day (or whatever deadline their rules state), the ballot is valid even if it arrives late. And if it arrives BEFORE Election Day? Well then it doesn't really matter, does it? The only reason for the dating rules at all is to enforce that you have to vote by election day, no later. The state Sec'y of State (the top elections official in the state) decided that for ballots that arrived by Election Day, if they lacked a date on the envelope they would still count. Because again, it doesn't matter, right? If it arrives AFTER Election Day and there's no date, your ballot doesn't count.

So-called 'Dark Brandon' really galvanised some people on the left, and an attitude of 'Fuck the GOP, we're fixing shit' is desperately needed.You're not going to win over the right, so instead they should fix shit and leave them with absolutely nothing but petty shit to complain about.",0.6511264,0

It has bases in hundreds of countries. Its Army and Navy and Air-Force are battle-tested. It has CIA, FBI, NSA, etc. It has militarised its police, it has National Guard. It has soft power in every country it has interacted with. It has financial ties with every nation that are their allies (and pragmatic allies). It has caused coups in various countries. It has spied upon various countries. It is responsible for various global recessions and a global depression. It has companies in countless countries. So many attributes to list for the global hegemon. It is the most powerful country in the world.If it goes full-on fascist, it will be exponentially worse than the usual state of affairs.

">A few months ago, Twitter promised to take its role in preserving election integrity seriously, saying that “[p]eople deserve to trust the election conversations and content they encounter on Twitter.” Now, in the middle of Brazil's presidential election and just ahead of the US midterms, the majority of Twitter staff who would be responsible for moderating content to help maintain election integrity reportedly don't have access to the tools they need to do that.>>...>>According to Bloomberg News, Twitter has significantly cut back on its content moderation staff approved to access a dashboard that logs automated and user-flagged content that requires human review before content is restricted. Ordinarily, hundreds of employees would be using the dashboard, reviewing content to manually enforce actions dictated by Twitter policy, such as banning or restricting accounts. Since last week, two Twitter safety team insiders told Bloomberg that the total number had been reduced to about 15 employees.>>Manually reviewed policy violations are usually the most high-profile violations, including those that could involve real-world harm, Twitter employees told Bloomberg.>>...>>Popular accounts spreading fake news that go unmoderated can be cause for public concern, which is why Twitter worked to expand its election integrity policy over the past five years. During the 2016 US presidential election, researchers reported in Science that on Twitter, “only 1% of individuals accounted for 80% of fake news source exposures.”>>Twitter did not respond to Ars' request to comment on how its current software code freeze might impact the company's ability to enforce its election integrity policy. Employees from Twitter's trust and safety team told Bloomberg that they “believe the company will be short-handed in enforcing policies in the run-up to the US midterm election on Nov. 8.” In a letter to advertisers, Musk said that while his purchase of Twitter was motivated to prevent polarization and help humanity, he understands that failure is a “very real possibility.”>>In the background of these elections, anonymous trolls have spammed Twitter with hate speech in the days since Musk took over. The Washington Post reported that their intent was to make as big a mess as possible to welcome Elon as the service's new owner.A reduction in content moderation staff and/or reducing their scope of work seems to be a dangerous move at this critical time in the political process. Based on past elections, we know that there are surges of misinformation and disinformation that run rampant prior to elections, and this coming midterm is likely to be no exception. Maybe if private platforms can't or won't manage dangerous misinformation on their own then the imposition of some additional statutory regulatory requirements might be helpful.",0.000956962,0

"A political party can't just suspend a corporation over statement made that they don't like. Legally it wouldn't fly. The company would take the action to court and win. You need sound legal standing to do this.Just like how everyone says that the DoJ needs to make an air tight case to prosecute Trump, the standing admin would need an air tight case that wouldn't get thrown out in courts if they did similarly.There's also the case that the first amendment protects citizens from retaliation of the government. Musk tweeting the what is obviously a false article is him exercising his free speech rights as dictated by the amendment, even if in doing so he looks like an asshole. And if the government retaliated against him for it, for that specific statement, it would be violating his first amendment rights.> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-1/Within that amendment is this:https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-7-3-7/ALDE_00013701/> By contrast, for example, the Court rejected one city's argument that it could prohibit as a nuisance any movie containing nudity which is visible from a public place.7 Concluding that the ordinance was not well tailored to the city's stated goals of protecting the privacy interests of passers-by or protecting children, the Court held instead that the law was an unconstitutional content-based regulation.Amendment 1.7.3 specifically deals with content neutrality judgements.Basically, to regulate content of speech made, the government would have to articulate to the court the specific harm his speech has done and then should the court agree, then the government can act on it.Also, keep in mind, that this action may focus on Musk as a thought experiment. But going down this road is like ripping the rip cord on your parachute after you jump out of a plane. It has huge societal implications and you can't just apply it to this one company and not have all the *other* companies in the country not have emergency meetings on what means for their future.Because if the government can lean and suspend a company over speech made by their CEO to such a degree, that means no other company is safe *either,* and the value of harm is subjective depending on *who* is in charge within the admin at the time.Imagine for a second that Trump's president, and you say ""fuck the POTUS for being a shitty person and for mishandling the pandemic response in the US.""And based on this one comment, made by a complete rando on the internet, reddit gets shut down. How insane would that be?Same principle here. *Independent of whether Musk acts like a twat with what he tweets.*Edit:One would argue that saying trump sucks for handling the pandemic poorly and tweeting out false reports to what was assault initially and then as more data came out basically premeditated murder are not the same.And that's the point also. The harm viewed is *relative* to *who* is in power. To the GOP, it's a Tuesday. To Democrats and society in general that believes in laws, it's a grievance. But because it is relative, suspension of corporations, cannot be arbitrary.I'll give you another example. Trump claiming that he declassified top secret documents cause he thought it. That's relative application of strict law that says to declassify you need to follow a process, it needs a paper trail, etc. You can't just say because you were president, if you thought something to happen, that it automagically happens.

They didn't know me or my email or anything. They didn't even have a record of the transaction themselves to help it from their end.I told that to PayPal and they gave me the runaround for two weeks, with three volleys back and forth that were clearly bots/form letter situations.Finally I got a different one that said to click a certain place and they'd give me the ""documentation used to make the determination"" that it was, in fact, legitimate.They never sent anything, electronically or in the mail, that would ever be considered genuine documentation. What they did send, two more weeks later, not responding to followups, was a sort of template email where, in the middle, it showed my IP address of my house. At a time when I was home alone (I checked my Google activity).I said I needed something more because I know it wasn't me buying anything and I *did* have proof of that, and the company who supposedly asked for my money didn't know I did, but that someone had my money.The response was basically, this is the last time we're saying this, did we stutter, that's your IP and we don't care about it after that point.So I took off the connection to my bank account, enabled 2FA (which I should have anyway) and no problems since.The only thing that makes sense to me is that, maybe, somehow, someone was outside of my house and somehow new my WiFi (it's goofy and pre-set from the cable company so they must have been someone we knew) and somehow guessed my nearly impossible password. That doesn't explain how they charged money to a company that doesn't acknowledge I exist -- I am honestly sort of curious who *did* receive it.But that seems so far-fetched that I close to 0% believe it.I am still sore about it though.The only people I have issues enough with to want to talk on the phone with are the same folks who don't have phone numbers to reach them at :)",0.001366154,0

"I'm unfamiliar with Twitters previous, current, or proposed future business plans so I am likely ignorant to other streams of income but how are they moving away from relying on advertisers when they have $1B annual debt servicing and I'm not familiar with any other way to make money off Twitter except for selling usage data or advertiser sales. If the platform becomes inhospitable to advertisers then it won't be very useful accessing the user data either I wouldn't think. Not many people advertise on 4Chan or how many researchers and market analysts pay to comb through the user data on 4Chan? It can't be many and there can't be a ton of money in it.Twitter can't just ignore the marketability of their platform and magically expect other revenue streams to appear. My understanding of why anyone uses Twitter is because companies and celebrities use it and put their day to day thoughts and announcements out on the platform. I have never met anyone who used Twitter actively for posting their own tweets, usually it's the occasional person who follows celebrities and personalities on the platform and the second it no longer becomes marketable for those users to utilize Twitter then I think they would lose a TON of their more casual users who only frequent the site to check up on their favourite celebrities or influencers and influencers won't stay on the platform I don't think if they can't sell ads on their content individually either.",0.00075185,0

E.g. a GAN, which pits two ais against each other to generate an output. One tries to fool the other. By modifying inputs to create a new output, an AI tries to fool a discriminator that tries to determine if the output of the other is real or not. Once it is fooled, you have an output to return.

He somehow got crazy momentum off of this, even though Bernie was decimating him in the other states, and had just won Nevada like 3 days before Biden's South Carolina win.

It is a move often made when a deadline approaches to preserve the status quo and give the justices more time to act. In a flurry of Trump related emergency petitions in recent days the justice with jurisdiction over the lower courts have decided to issue such temporary relief. Justice Elena Kagan, for example issued such a stay on October 26 temporarily blocking a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attacks for phone and text records of Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward. Justice Clarence Thomas froze an order on October 24 requiring the testimony of Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham before a Georgia grand jury.Remember that oral arguments started for the Harvard/UNC affirmative action cases started on Monday, SCOTUS is busy and wanted to give themselves some time to consider the issue.",0.000666122,0

"So this is basically a TRO to allow the Court time to decide if it wants to take up the appeal from the Trump Org. Some thoughts here:1. This type of action is not unusual due to the ""irreparable harm"" (legal term) that would happen if they released the taxes. Essentially once the genie is out of the box, there's no going back -- you can't ""undisclose"" the taxes.2. It's absurd, but it's probably the correct decision by Roberts to grant this temporary injunction, particularly when he takes into account his new 'role' on the Court -- his job moving forward will be to try to get 1+ of the Republicans on the Court to flip to prevent super outrageous rulings, i.e., what he tried to do on the SCOTUS. He needs to play a careful game if he wants any chance of preserving his legacy. 3. This will delay any decision to release the records until after the election. 4. If I were the Republicans on the Court, I would grant cert on this case and then rule against Trump. This would delay turning over the documents for like another full year and by that point it will be somewhat irrelevant because he'll be in full 'running for president' mode and they will be able to swing anything as politics vs actual Trump breaking the law. This has the advantage of giving the Republicans on the Court 'cover' while they continue to act against their oaths of office. 5. The fact that #4 is what's likely to happen is only a further illustration of why we need to add several new judges to the Court.",0.001394954,0

"This is another one of those times where I am glad I developed a healthy, realistic set of expectations. I figure I might share in the hopes it improves others mental health and ability to live in this world - assume Congress will do nothing good for America but everything it possibly can to increase the wealth of shareholders of international corporations since that is who realistically owns them, pays them, and gets them re-elected. Assume the Supreme Court is a fascist institution that will do everything in its power to destroy the Constitution, disrespect the public, and install a White Christian Nationalist government while protecting itself from the defensive forces of our former pluralistic democracy, as the long term right wing fascist purchase of political power and grooming of fascist judges has won, they have the majority on the Court. Assume the Democratic Party as an institution will say the right thing and then never do anything substantive except enrich their owners. Assume the Republican Party will do nothing but prey on ignorance and grievance, and fear monger and undermine democracy in pursuit of power to enrich their shareholders. Once you accept the reality of the situation, you are less surprised by these kinds of events as they are more expected, and the good events are pleasant surprises. It's much easier to live while being informed and still be able to function day to day without being entirely overwhelmed by the dread inducing headline of the day. And to those of you who say this is so pessimistic and defeatist, it's not. It's realistic and has been very accurate for the last several years, and I still hold onto tremendous amounts of hope - revolutions are regular throughout history and heads have rolled before, black swans and sudden tumultuous change is the norm. I hold out hope for a sudden breaking, an instance of creative destruction, but I expect nothing but anti-democracy, anti-life, anti-human action from the current power structure in America because it is what it has shown itself to be - a simple extractive mechanism for the elite to suck the life, wealth and power out of democracy, life on earth, and humanity to enrich itself in the short term and maintain its position of power.

"I'm disappointed in the decision as much as many, but I have got to be honest: unless we're looking at potential criminal behavior to then make a recommendation to the DOJ, I don't really put a lot of stock into what getting his taxes will give people. The sad truth is that there is a mountain of evidence that shows that Trump is a lying huckster that's made a second fortune off of the backs of his supporters. That he was likely bankrupt or close to it before he commercialized the hell out of his campaign, making himself a golden idol of culture for the lowest rungs of society. We know he's been bankrupt *six* times, each time for overleveraging properties. We know he essentially pumped government money into his own pockets from overcharging Secret Service for stays on his properties. We know that he essentially used his DC hotel to accept essentially what were donations from foreign nations and businesses. We know about his fraudulent Trump University and his myriad of public failures, from Trump Airlines, Trump Steaks, to ruining the beautiful creature that was the USFL. We know everything about how bad of an unethical businessman he is.Anyone with a moderate grasp of reality knows that, and I don't see how putting a number on it will really accomplish much.

"SCOTUS has to determine if they will hear the appeal and is asking the committee to explain why they shouldn't. Ideally, SCOTUS will get the response and decline to hear the appeal. The last time they heard this case (yes, Trump has already appealed this to the Supreme Court once before) they told Trump that his argument wasn't good enough and to try again. His argument is even weaker now that he is no longer President so they should decline to hear it but the court is corrupted so who knows what will happen. They may hear it and give Trump another do over.",0.000753619,0
"So when a court rules that something has to be done and the losing party doesn't want that, they can appeal to a higher court. The question is: What happens in the meantime? Should the previous ruling be implemented? Or should it be held back until the appeals process is finished?In some cases, when the situation is easily reversed, the ruling can simply be implemented. If I sue you over some amount of money and I win, I get to keep (or receive) the money and if the appeal comes out the other way, I simply hand the money over to you.But it gets murky when it's harder to revert such a transfer. In the case of documents containing private information, there is no way to ""unrelease"" the documents once the other party has received them (and studied them).So what you do when you appeal (to the Court of Appeals or afterwards to SCOTUS) is that you file for a stay of the order of the lower court. Such a stay will pause the previous ruling from being implemented until the appeals process is completed (which may be with an appeal not even being taken up by SCOTUS).In this case, Trump petitioned SCOTUS to freeze the ruling while he files an appeal. SCOTUS (technically, it's just a single Justice as each court circuit has its own Justice who handles such emergency filings, but they can involve the full court) can simply deny or grant it outright or can request a reply from the other party and then rule.Right now, Chief Justice Roberts decided to ask the other side to file their response as to why the previous ruling needs to be implemented right away and he will then decide whether or not to grant the stay. If granted, it's not yet a final decision, just a temporary hold. Trump then has to complete his appeal petition for the Supreme Court and they have to decide to take up the case (most cases are declined by SCOTUS). If SCOTUS takes up the case, then both sides get to argue over the merits and a ruling is made (this would take months if not more). If SCOTUS declines to take up the case, the previous ruling holds (which orders the release of the documents).The situation is shitty, but I can see the reasoning behind this current order. You can't ""unrelease"" documents if the case ends up going for Trump in the end. If you don't want some personal information revealed, then first having it revealed and only later winning a court case that says that it shouldn't have been revealed in the first place won't do you any good as the damage is done.If there's one thing that Trump is good in (and there probably aren't many more) is dragging stuff like this out for a very long time by throwing every procedural trick in the book at it. Probably at the cost of a lot of legal fees.",0.011535237,0

"Trump filed a petition asking for the block, and alternatively, asking for the Supreme Court to take the case up on the merits. The lower courts had ordered release of Trump's tax returns to the Committee by November 3rd IIRC. If the tax returns were released, the issue would be moot, and any potential litigation over them would have been pointless. The Supreme Court intervened to preserve the issue, just in case it is a viable legal claim. While a great many people think Trump's arguments are meritless, it isn't that unusual for the Court to grant a temporary stay to give both sides a chance to submit further arguments, before the Court decides to more substantively intervene. The Temporary Stay in this case is to prevent Trump from losing his case effectively by default (the release of the documents on November 3rd), even in the long-shot scenario where his arguments are actually considered to hold water. I want to reiterate: I don't think they do. But this is a fairly routine action by the Court that's getting somewhat sensationalized.

"I think it is critical for people's safety to realize these are not normal times. That we - along with many other countries right now - are going through a rise of right wing extremism and fascism, which historically finds it easier to spread during times of difficulty or recession when people want a 'strong' leader. This case is not an aberration. As the weeks, months, and years continue forward you are going to see more and more of this. If you think about it, we are already seeing not just the warning signs, but full blown collapse of the system and institutions we expect to protect us. Some cases will go the way they should, but more and more they won't. Even when it becomes blatant that they are diverging from all the norms and rules. We've already seen that with abortion rights where there was no legal support and it violated their own rules of stare decisis. One or two members on a jury will just refuse to convict leaders of their party, even when charges are brought. Eventually I will not be surprised if 'maga' folks just won't convict others. We are already at the point where I don't think a a major maga player could be convicted at all. You'd have to be lucky enough to not have a trump supporter out of the entire jury. It just takes one. Remember how white juries would just not convict other whites in the south? These MAGA people are the children and grandchildren of those juries. They have the same hate and unfairness in their hearts, and it can and will happen that they approve of the use of stealing, cheating, and lying, as long as the 'right' people aren't getting hurt, and the 'wrong' people are getting hurt. Judges will twist the law to give rights to certain people, like Christians, but not others, like Muslims or atheists. Again, we're already seeing this happen in red states - the 'in god we trust' sign law in Texas. The legislature will act in bad faith, refuse to certify judges, refuse to concede elections, push lies about who won. Bedrocks like church and state separation are going to erode and it will feel surreal. Federal and state. This is not a prediction, it's already occurring and we're all reading articles on it every day. We are - right now - the frog in the pot, and it is already boiling. The GOP is pushing straight up lies about the election of our president, encouraging violence, has abandoned all civility... and their odds of making gains in Congress have only gone up. Our neighbors support them. They are voting for them. They have been fully entrenched in news bubble so extreme that QAnon is no longer fringe in the party, and fully 2/3 republicans do not believe Joe Biden won despite absolutely no evidence of significant fraud. These are not tenable positions.Just look at how extreme they are already. Celebrating an elderly man being assaulted. Immediately jumping on the conspiracy theory and enjoying mocking him, his wife, their family. The sick thing is that the attacker did it to try and make democrats afraid. And instead of showing support, the GOP has fully embraced the violence and pain of that message. Ask yourself honestly what percentage of GOP voters are ok with what happened.

"Plenty of Americans are willing to believe absolute nonsense, but as a non-American please know this is absolutely normal and, problematic though the Court may be in so many other regards, not at all what people are asserting here. The US Treasury Department is set to deliver Trump's records to the Congressional committee this week in accordance with the order of a lower court. Once that happens, the cat's out of the bag. You can order them to forget what they read and destroy all copies, but they'll already have the info. This is a temporary order blocking that for a bit over a week so that the respondents (the Congressional committee) can file a brief arguing why the Supreme Court shouldn't block them from getting the records for months while this case is pending. Once the committee responds, it goes to the full Court to actually vote on it. This happens all the time. Justice Sotomayor did it in a case this summer involving whether a religious college had to recognize LGBT student organizations. She then voted a week later to reject the application for a stay. Justice Thomas did it last week in a case involving Lindsey Graham's request to quash a subpoena requiring him to testify before a grand jury. Per the order today, he voted to reject Graham's request (or, rather, the Court rejected it in an [unsigned order](https://docs-cdn-prod.news-engineering.aws.wapo.pub/publish_document/9af74d77-5587-4c83-bd8f-30cbd51c1717/published/9af74d77-5587-4c83-bd8f-30cbd51c1717.pdf) that had no dissents). Justice Kagan did it last week in a case still pending about whether a different set of election deniers has to hand over their records. This is normal procedure. It just gives the Court time to gather info and arguments to make a decision. Again, none of this is to say that the US Supreme Court isn't problematic and a threat to democracy in all sorts of ways, and certainly not at all a suggestion that one of our major political parties is an explicit threat to democracy and the rule of law. This order isn't that threat, though. This is how it's supposed to work. The timing being so close to the election is happenstance of the timing of the order below and the appeal. Even with a compressed timeline, they still likely wouldn't get to it before the election just because it takes time for the respondents to write a brief, and the Court needs time to consider the arguments raised.",0.003054591,0
"There are no institutions in place to protect democracy. There never have been. There can't be. Democracy is protected by the will of the electorate.This is the premise behind Benjamin Franklin's famous quote, ""a republic, if you can keep it"", when asked by a member of the public what had been created by the constitutional convention of 1787.It's also something that we can prove must be true, if we follow through a few logical implications.We start with the premise that there is a representative democracy, and that the representatives ""decide how the society should be run"", which in less abstract terms means they ""make laws"", and this group is the legislature.Any rules you want to impose - whether to ""protect democracy"" through the creation of systems or institutions, or any other rules, are therefore determined by these representatives.The supreme court cannot make laws, but only strike them down on the basis of non-constitutionality. Of course, the supreme court can read a law with some interpretation that bends in the direction they desire. But that only means that the proposal goes back to the legislature to be made clearer, or more precise, or more specific.Since these representative are elected it follows that if they are making laws that the electorate disagrees with then the electorate can vote them out in favour of new representatives who will make laws that the electorate agrees with. There are obvious technical details here about how you determine the majority position of the electorate, but these too are just laws. So at the end of the day the will of the electorate is the fundamental mechanism of democracy.It should be clear that if the representatives try to create an ""institution to protect democracy"" - in other words they write some laws - then those laws are only as reliable as the support of the electorate. If the electorate disagrees with the laws, new representatives will come in and get rid of those previous laws. So if the electorate decides they care about protecting democratic principles, they ultimately have the authority to enforce that over the long term. If the electorate decides they want the death penalty imposed for petty crime, then they have the ultimate authority to enforce that, too.The absurdity or otherwise of what the electorate wants is irrelevant. So if one wants civilization to progress according to principles you might believe in - the grounding of claims in fact and/or reason, looking after people other than yourself, the effectiveness of cooperation, and so on, you need an electorate that on the whole agrees with you.",0.000811432,0

Because trump is the first presidential candidate in decades (ever?) to not release their tax returns while running for office. He repeatedly handwaved all requests as not possible because they're under a seemingly decade long audit even though federal agencies confirmed there was nothing preventing him from releasing them in their totality. He has also dragged his feet every step of the way when others try to procure them. He made a spectacle of himself and it's made people more invested in seeing the outcome.

"> Why can't anyone convicted of any crime, just appeal it to the Supreme Court and have them issue stays until the supreme court reviews?When someone is charged with a crime and convicted by a court, the default assumption is that the conviction (and the process used to reach it) was correct, therefore the sentence is carried out and appeals are considered after the fact. This makes sense; it would be pretty bizarre to go through that entire process, present all the evidence, hear both sides, rule that the person is guilty as charged...and then have them carry on their normal life pending potentially years of appeals.But this is not that kind of case; Trump has not been charged with any crime. Instead, Congress is investigating whether or not he *should* be charged with a crime. In all such cases, the suspected person has legal rights. Among those is the right to contest the disclosure of private information. This makes sense, because such disclosures can potentially ruin a person, who may turn out never to have done what they're suspected of. The courts, therefore, require those who want that information disclosed to justify why it needs to be. The onus is on them. Again, this makes sense.> The fact is they CHOSE to do this, they chose to review this.

Not not non hyperbolic tho. It's just masking it as moderation. This is an unprecedented call from the Supreme Court. They can simply decline the review the unambiguous wording of the law that requires the IRS to turn over any tax return regardless of who they are asking for.

That's a question the SCOTUS needs to answer and it makes perfectly good sense for Kagan to issue a stay to figure it out first, even if I'd like them to hand the phone records over.In this case the law is crystal clear. The IRS has to turn over tax documents if the Chairman of the Ways and Means committee requests them from the Treasury. It's established law Congress passed. The appellate court laid that out in their unanimous decision when Trump appealed. There's no compelling reason Roberts issued a stay on this. There's not a question at its core that the SCOTUS needs to answer like the Jan 6 case. Any fair reading of the law would show Trump is out of options in this case but he got exactly what he wanted anyways.

The growth curve that's driven the expansion of global capitalism is going to reverse, as there simply will be fewer people making and consuming resources, and our financial systems will require an overhaul to address this problem.The bigger challenge over the next century will be about how people manage the impending financial collapse, and what they blame for the cause.

"That's optimistic. Roe was huge news over the summer and abortion became *the* most important issue for Democrats and drove voter registration and early votes, but it's faded from headlines over the past month or two. That directly correlates with more Democratic and independent voters ranking abortion as lower priority when polled on important issues, and Republicans have been gaining in the polls ever since as the post-Roe wave dies down and issues like the economy and immigration (Republican campaigning/fearmongering bread and butter) regain their usual importance in people's minds. Barring a huge number of upsets in the House, Congress will be deadlocked *at best* for the last half of Biden's term, and there's a significant chance that both chambers flip.Democrats had over a 66% chance to win the Senate based on 538's model in late September/early October, and about a 30% chance to win the House. Now it's 50/50 for the Senate and less than 20% for the House.Add in that SCOTUS is poised to rule on Moore v Harper in December, and at least 3 sitting justices will endorse the independent state legislature theory, and there's a substantial risk that the next two years result in no significant federal legislation, resulting in a Republican presidential victory in 2024, and Republican states taking advantage of their newly unilateral electoral authority to create whatever process they need to ensure a Republican Congress in perpetuity.

"I'm no expert either, so I'm sure 99% of the comments in here are just political musings about this.

The court hears a lot of appeal requests and most get dismissed yes, but they probably also don't need a stay to be ordered for those because there might not be any harm happening if there was no stay. In this case, specifically, the court issued a stay because releasing the tax returns before the case could be heard (if the court decides to do that) would be a harm that could not be undone. So to me it makes sense that they issue the stay while they decide whether or not to take the case. Usually yes, they take up a case because there are mixed interpretations across lower courts, but that's not the only reason. In addition, look at the opinion they just released where they dismissed Graham's appeal trying to get out of testifying in front of the jury. They issued a stay in that to prevent any harm while the case worked its way through, and even though they issued a stay, they ultimately denied his request.

Say they decline the case, but next year a republican congress tries to get Biden's taxes (or any future congress v president cases) now there will be a delay cause it has to go through the courts again. If they take it up and say yes (or no), then there won't be a significant delay the second time around.

But you also gotta realize we have been telling folks since the 60s that our elections are life and death (think back the Daisy Girl as, suggesting that a vote against President Johnson was a vote for nuclear annihilation).We always hear it. A vote for Reagan in 1980 means escalating the cold War. A vote for Clinton in 92 means no more law and order, rampant crime and your kids will suffer. A vote for GOP in 2010 means Obamacare will be overturned and the Civil Rights Act abolished. Yes, some bad things will happen if the GOP takes the house. And my loved ones will suffer. And that'll suck. And I'll work tirelessly to help. But it's not ""the end of democracy"". It's a setback. Like a lot of setbacks.

The House, on the other hand, is so gerrymandered, due to Republican cheating, that it is really hard for Democrats to win majorities there.Those are just facts and basic math.

"There are many different theories of how regeneration of a population creates change in society, Strauss and Howe have developed what is called in Formal sociology a ‘pulse-rate' theory, or that regeneration occurs on set intervals, however they developed their theory from combining Karl Mannheim's cohort theory model, which was a synthesis of pulse-rate and imprint theory, with Erik Erikson's stage of life theory of the psychology of identity. It is clear in hindsight that their model is one that is not proven in any factual sense, and can make sense no matter where you plug in the numbers, which have allowed grifters like Jason Dorsey to pose as an authority to sell books.So in conclusion, I recommend you read Karl Mannheim's “the sociological problem of generations” to get the foundation of this field. And I also encourage you to read Bobby Duffy's 2021 “the Generation Myth” I would say that the UK's Bobby Duffy is the foremost authority on Generations at the moment.

Then you'll say *misinformed* due to right-wing propaganda, and that's not completely off base either. It's a thing, but how much of it is pure misinformation vs partial truths that reinforce an already apathetic (non) voter?There are plenty of reason people don't vote. For the past 20 years, it has not really mattered to *most* people, so far as impacting their day-to-day lives, which party has had control over the federal government. Dems did some big things for sure - most notably protecting pre-existing conditions.. but they also offered many false promises, hollow words, and generally act a whole lot like Republicans when it comes to anything other than social issues that cannot be fully resolved via policy. Biden ran on a policy of *not giving everyone healthcare*, and the average *voting* Democrat decided he was their guy. If you're voting against the well-being of a class of people, do not fucking expect them to lead the cavalry charge when you need them to bail you out. ""But but... fascism. If you don't want that, our goals now align, and you should vote with us!"" Oh, damn. When it's *your* ass on the line, and when it's *your* comfortable lifestyle and freedoms that are at risk, suddenly you cannot understand why someone would be assed not to ""do the right thing""??? Weird how that works. Dems wouldn't need to beg for support just to *avoid fascism* if they had just delivered substantive day-to-day life changing legislation for the marginalized people whose votes they now need. They're not even promising that in the future - they're running on ""sure, we won't make your life better, but the other guys are fascists!"" If you're already a low wage worker with no real ability to affect your own future, do you think fascism really means fuck all to you? You won't want to admit it, but a good chunk of Americans aren't all that ""free.""And then, on the flip side, there are states where the outcome is a foregone conclusion. It's still worth voting because otherwise, change will never happen, but if your elections are a foregone conclusion, you'll have less turnout.

Because their entire voter base is one built on fear and was raised in an environment when oppression was fully and legally systematized.

">democracy has been gradually declining for decadeDo you really believe this? Do you truly believe it was easier to be gay in 1977 than it is today?

The ACA (""Obamacare"") made healthcare accessible to families like mine who had just gone without insurance for a generation beforehand. Crime rates are lower now than they've been in decades. Trans actors get starring roles in film and TV. I call this progress. And it happened, despite GOP controlled house and Senate many different times. It happened despite Reagan, Bush, Bush and Trump being president. It happened despite Thomas and Alito being on SCOTUS. We still manage to move forward. I was told in 2000 that if Bush won, the country would never recover. Yet we did. I was told in 2008 that if Obama won, ""our country is through"". And we were fine. Now you tell me that if the GOP takes the house 2022, it's all over. Pack your bags, flee to Canada or the EU and say goodbye to the US Constitution. And I disagree.

This is unfortunately because they have to spend most of their time countering deliberate misinformation, when the facts should speak for themselves.If republicans didn't have the corner on lying, spinmeisters...they wouldn't have no luck at all.

"Okay, so let's look at voting.In the 50s, there were separate polling places for blacks and whites in many states. Now there are not. Sounds like progress, even though the GOP (and southern racist ""Dixiecrats"") fought tooth and nail to stop it. They failed and we moved forward.Donald Trump and his band of crazies tried to stop the outcome of the 2020 election. They even stormed the US Capitol and killed people, and they failed. The election went thru and we got the officials we voted for.You're right, we face unique challenges today, and we should work out butts off to address them. But fearmongering doesn't help because it's a ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" situation.I turned 18 in the early 2000s. I was told that if Bush won in 04, that would be it for American democracy. He stole the white house in 2000 we all knew it. And if we didn't defeat him in 04, he'd go hog wild. I mean, he lost in 2000 and still started a needless bullshit war in Iraq. I was whipped into a frenzy in 04. I protested. I marched with signs. I voted, of course. I helped others vote, and we all lined up behind Kerry, since he was our only shot at saving our democracy from a tyrant who illegally seized the office 4 years earlier.And we failed.Bush won, of course. This was it. Our greatest fears had been realized. With the madman Cheney by his side, we'd never have a legit government again. Kucinich even tried to impeach Bush but it went nowhere. I was so distraught. Suicidal, even. What's the point of living in a fascist authoritarian state? American democracy was over. We had a guy who didn't care about vote totals. He proved that in 2000, and now we are stuck with him.Then, in 08, we elected Obama. Bush quietly left the White House and Obama took office in 09.All that ""End of Democracy"" fearmongering felt kinda silly. And it made me numb to these scary claims we see today.Yes, I still march. I still carry signs and protest when I feel it's necessary (I've marched with BLM, Trump impeachment rally and pro-choice groups). But I no longer go around preaching the gospel of ""end of American democracy"" because that's just not what is actually at stake here. Just like how a vote against Johnson in 64 wasn't actually a vote for nuclear war. Just like a vote for Obama isn't a vote for socialism (I wish it was).American democracy will chug on, regardless of what the GOP tries to do. They may have some modest success in fucking with voting access in Alabama and Texas, then they'll get sued or the Federal Government will pass a law like the Voting Rights Act and we will be fine.

"> One thing is for sure. If you choose not to vote, you just give up. Don't give up.Only if you believe there's an actual fight. Why are we so far behind other less wealthy developed countries on this stuff? Voting isn't going to do shit, and really never has. Every positive development in history was driven by blood. Republicans seem to get that, but you guys just want to keep harping on about voting in a broken system where it never seems to have a meaningful effect.Nothing will happen as long as the ruling classes and their stooges (republicans) think that they have a monopoly on violence and aren't threatened by it. Nothing ever has really. There is nothing to vote for, because the rules of the system are not in effect. Society had a social pact that has been abused past breaking, but only one party seems to recognize that and capitalizes on that. That's why Trump gets to ignore the law and do whatever the fuck he wants, because democratic politicians are scared of the violence that will happen on his behalf. The FBI and Secret Service are controlled by psychotic conservatives, and Michael Flynn's brother maintains control over a large portion of the military.Cry vote vote vote all you want, they are armed and ready.

"I'm the first person to agree that their record and stance is quite frankly, usually the better and stronger one when it comes to actions. But to counter what you just put there....this is, again, EXACTLY what republicans want. Focus on the social issues and not on the ones demonstrably more prescient for the majority of blue collar workers. I.e., the economic numbers and the ways democratic policies help to address the wage gap and boost our overall economic production levels in favor of the workers.With that said, I also think they should be *hammering* the abortion issue right now, and calling out all the cowards who took it down from their websites and platforms the moment republican SCOTUS (re)entered the fray. The problem is that if they focus too hard on that, the economy gets drowned out and the GOP has them back where they want them: arguing about ephemeral, socially tinged issues when the ones in black and white should provide dunk after dunk in every Republican's face.I guess my overarching point is that the Republican *voters* are the ones who are at issue here: they are unwilling to accept the truth of the numbers when faced with them (i.e., they doubt them no matter the source), and are overly willing to jump right in with both feet when it comes to social justice oriented criticisms of the Democratic platform. Basically, both their media and their viewer base are primed to churn out the chum and then voraciously gobble it up and spew it back out for others to hear.

Fun fact… that's actually how most things work right now for people with jobs… the employer every year says “we paid you X why should we pay you Y?”If you go into a job interview without knowing how much the job pays then you failed at getting to know your market and shouldn't get the job.

"> SAN FRANCISCO — About six years ago, David DePape was down on his luck, living under a tree in a park and hanging around outside a lumber store in Berkeley, Calif., looking for work.“You know how people sit outside and wait for someone to come and offer them work?” recalled Frank Ciccarelli, a carpenter who builds houses and makes furniture. “He was sitting there. So I picked him up. So he started working for me. And he really worked out well.”For the next several years Mr. Ciccarelli became close to Mr. DePape, even as he worked less and seemed to spend more time online, immersed in right-wing conspiracy theories — right up until a week ago, when he paid Mr. DePape his most recent wages.Mr. DePape, 42, on Tuesday pleaded not guilty in a brief appearance in a San Francisco courtroom to several state felony charges after investigators say he broke into the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week in the well-to-do Pacific Heights neighborhood and bludgeoned her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer. Mr. DePape also faces federal charges of attempting to kidnap Ms. Pelosi and assaulting a relative of a federal official that were outlined in a complaint filed on Monday.Investigators say Mr. DePape was on a mission to take Ms. Pelosi hostage, interrogate her and break her kneecaps if she “lied” to him. The speaker, the nation's third most powerful political figure, was in Washington at the time of the attack.The police said the case was politically motivated, and it has heightened fears of political violence ahead of the midterm elections, amid a surge in threats to lawmakers across the country that officials have blamed on the intense proliferation of conspiracy theories and violent rhetoric circulating in right-wing social media.Mr. DePape was assigned a public defender, Adam Lipson, to represent him. In comments after Tuesday's court appearance, Mr. Lipson said he first met his client on Monday evening; Mr. DePape was recently moved to the county jail from a hospital, where he was treated for a dislocated shoulder he sustained during the arrest.Mr. Lipson promised to mount a “vigorous defense” and signaled that one possible strategy could be to highlight his client's “vulnerability” to the misinformation and conspiracy theories that have become so prominent in American political life.Mr. Ciccarelli, 76, described Mr. DePape as a quiet person and a diligent worker — an easygoing guy, at least until the topic of politics came up.“We were together four or five days a week, four or five hours a day, a lot of times an hour in the car, going back and forth from jobs,” Mr. Ciccarelli said. “I think I know him better than anyone does.”Over the six years he has known Mr. DePape, Mr. Ciccarelli said, he witnessed a transformation from a shy and hardworking, but troubled, man into someone who was increasingly isolated and captive to his darkest thoughts.“If you got him talking about politics, it was all over,” Mr. Ciccarelli recalled in an interview this week. “Because he really believed in the whole MAGA, ‘Pizzagate,' stolen election — you know, all of it, all the way down the line. If you go to Fox News, if you go on the internet and you look at QAnon, you know, he had all these theories.”political leanings — ranting about the 2020 election being stolen, appearing to deny the gassing of Jews at Auschwitz and claiming that schoolteachers were grooming children to be transgender. He also targeted the media in one post, arguing that any journalist who said the 2020 election was not stolen to deny former President Donald J. Trump a new term “should be dragged straight out into the street and shot.” Mr. DePape's blog was registered at the Richmond address where he resided.He reposted videos about right-wing themes, including those celebrating people who had not been vaccinated, mixed in with messages about buying survivalist food supplies and gold. A post on Thursday, the day before the attack on the Pelosi residence, denounced the new superhero movie “Black Adam” for its “wokism,” and claimed it was about finding an excuse to depict “killing with people in all white nations.” In another post from last week, he showed an antisemitic video and suggested Jews had manipulated Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, into destroying Ukraine so they could buy up its land cheaply.Mr. Ciccarelli, who said he was scheduled to work with Mr. DePape on Monday, said he never heard Mr. DePape make racist comments, but said he had become increasingly isolated the last few years and wanted to work less in the carpentry business.“He was completely caught up in the fantasy, in the MAGA fantasy,” he said.Over the last few days, Mr. Ciccarelli has struggled to make sense of the news about his friend. “He did a monstrous thing, but he's not a monster,” he said. “He's really decent, gentle — it sounds crazy to say gentle — but he was a very gentle soul. But he was going downhill. He went down the rabbit hole.”Charlie Savage, Alan Feuer and Livia Albeck-Ripka contributed reporting.Tim Arango is a Los Angeles correspondent.

Five of those 7 formerly heavily blue states are now purple except for now red Ohio. The party has been bleeding Latino votes for years despite loud, repeated warnings of failure. Did the DNC care? No.Party 'leaders' are incompetent in elections. There is no marketing. The messaging is incoherent, sporadic, dull, and off base.

Ask 10 Dem officials on TV for their view about issue X and you 30 different opinions! That is this week. Ask them next week and you get 30 new opinions. Everyone knows what the GOP stands.

"This definition completely ignores the obvious - that fascism reasserts supremacy of the “masculine,” which is essential to maintain male supremacy. It is a regression to medieval level brutality, Mussolini was a virulent misogynist who glorified brutality, the rural man, claimed that Italian men had become “weak” and loathed artists and intellectuals and communists because they were not “real” men, and of course hated homosexuals. He attacked reproductive rights as well as the right to work certain jobs, Hitler declared that women were good for “children, kitchen, church” banned abortion for “Aryan” women, Franco encouraged his soldiers to rape women during the Spanish Civil War, especially women's rights activists, their breasts were branded with irons, the garotte was used for execution, etc. In 2022 in the US women are going septic from pregnancy complications and having to be transported hours away to other states to get a life saving termination thanks to draconian abortion laws. The backlash against women's rights that has been picking up steam globally for the last decade is not a coincidence, it is the bloody red flag warning the fascists are coming. And the brutality rapidly turns from women rights as a target to violence towards the “other” since the goal is not to eliminate women (needed for babies, free labour in the home, and sex), but fascists can go scorched earth on an “other” that is not considered necessary, and in the worst scenarios leads to genocide. Brutality is essential for oppression of any group and for empirebuilding.There is no male supremacy without violence, and masculine supremacy is required to maintain male domination and for the permission and glorification of violence. It's not a coincidence that fascism became popular after women started getting the vote, and it's not a coincidence in this century that fascism is rising after women gained more and more power and LGBTQ+ gained rights. It doesn't matter how many rightwing women are eagerly participating in a movement that will eventually lead to their own demise, however much temporary power they are gaining by supporting masculine supremacy and brutality, they are providing cover and are completely grotesque in their zeal to support a movement that hates women's equality. The “feminine” with its association with compassion is an existential threat to the goals of brutal men that often include empire building.",0.0458981,0

Nobody on the Left is engaging in constant stochastic terrorism, dehumanizing those on the Right and making thinly-veiled advocacy for physically attacking them. When someone from the Left does threaten or engage in political violence, nobody else on the Left turns them into a hero, inviting them to rallies, seeking their endorsement, invokes their name favorably, or makes them into a martyr.

About 1 in 300,000 people will be killed by police every year. Most of these are justifiable. Sometimes police shoot people. Active shooters, for example. Certain behaviors increase your risk of (justifiable) violent interactions with police. These behaviors are unfortunately disproportionately found in some groups of people. This is due to economic disparity and other cultural factors, but that's besides the point. So to sum it up do you think it's at all possible that a group of people that was enslaved and subsequently discriminated against economically and politically on an institutional level for almost 200 years is more likely to be participating in cycles of violence in bad neighborhoods that bankers and city planners trapped them in?

If you weren't a conservative, you would be probably able to tell the difference between terrorism and protesting. Like my previous post gives peer-reviewed evidence for though, you conservatives are more reactive to fear based emotional arguments like “BLM is burning down Portland” with a 4 second clip of black people seeming angry so you just ran headlong down a propaganda rabbit hole and now literally live in a fantastical reality where the DNC organized mass violence, but when MTG is literally calling out for Pelosi's death and a right winger tried to deliver your fine with the entire right wing media establishment piling on to call him a gay leftist even after his statement to the police about how he intended to kill Pelosi, and had other targets is public.

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The REPUBLICANS have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors.

You should still be wary about a bull in a china shop because he can gore you… but I don't know that I would necessarily attribute being in a china shop as “all part of the bulls plan”.

He has all of Trumps most glaring personality flaws, but with none of the plausible deniability regarding what his policy choices would look like. Those same issues are what cost Trump and the Republicans a second term, as well as the House and Senate. His feud with Trump will only intensify as well, and if Trump runs as an Independent, or tells his followers not to vote for DeSantis, that could also be a problem for him moving forward.

"But the question remains, does he have the capability to take that nationwide? Your average rich conservative likes him, but I think a big part of what drew the Republican base to Trump was the underdog-ness of it all - the financial interests openly hated the guy, but he said bigoted shit openly, so he seemed almost authentic to your average conservative.

MAGA people (though they will leave nice Twitter comments). You know who sees through this all and turned off by it?....-Elon graciously allows the US government to purchase his satellites and graciously takes the credit. Then sets up a fight with a Ukrainian official, then withdrawals capabilities of the satellites, then reinstates service after the US Givernment pays him more and receiving a shady metal deal for Tesla from a Russian company. HUGE 5TH DEGREE CHESS WIN FOR ELON AGAIN! I mean, except, if he was trying to sell luxury cars to a population of people wildly supportive of the Ukraine. And even heard about him withholding his satellites capacities............ Everything about this Twitter acquisition (I can't even bring myself to elaborate). But, to summarize, thus has been an empirerors new clothes scenario, where outsiders are finally getting the depth of this guy's narcissism and ignorance.Finally, by presenting a conspiracy article about Pelosis husband, Elon thought he was showing the far right that they are welcome to Twitter toob(and Tesla!!!). But it's as if he forgot that the population with disposable income and an interest in EVs might be pissed about overt misinformation and tolerance towards racism....So I'm stringing my violin",0.0278577,0

It used to be that if I smelled smoke near my house, I could search for a tag of my city and I might see someone posting that their neighbor's house was on fire. But the ""following"" of different parties was better, it was great to be able to know if my favorite band was going on tour or something like that, without having to subscribe to their email mailing list (which was often marked as spam). But then it became a propaganda tool.Reddit is going down the same path. It is interesting to talk to people you don't know about issues. But then fucking propagandists show up, many of them paid, to waste people's time in unproductive discussion, or just spamming with propaganda. I suppose the news is another example of this - news used to be pretty non-controversial, then Fox News showed up with its propaganda, lying to people, or sowing doubt, or just driving people to new levels of fear.I think that if we could figure out how to address propaganda, we might be able to solve this all.",0.34524003,0

"Range vs price is a pretty awful metric to determine a vehicle's cost value proposition. There are loads of metrics that go into a person's feelings on a vehicle. Range became a huge talking point early on when skeptical ""journalists"" tried to undermine an EV's ability to road trip before charging infrastructure was widespread, and before it was well understood how road tripping in an EV actually works. EV enthusiasts, primarily Tesla owners, informed people that more range wasn't critical because charging doesn't add much time to the trips with the lion's share of charging done during eating / bathroom breaks. As people got informed, the range debate went away. Then suddenly other competitors started hitting the market and range became a way for Tesla owners/shareholders to win a pissing contest between brands. ""Tesla gets the most range, that means they're the best and other brands are inferior!""Today we're getting real world tests over long distances that show range doesn't make a profound impact on trip times so long as the vehicles being compared each have decent range and solid charging curves... (unless towing)The e-tron for example was highly criticized initially when its range was announced, but due to its high / flat charging curve, it could still road trip with the best of them.Only concentrating on range ignores all other vehicle metrics that matter to customers, like...* ride quality and road compliance* road noise* interior comfort* interior quality and appointments* driver's cluster / HUD* build quality* handling performance* part longevity* fit and finish (especially interior where creeks can develop)* etc...Tesla likes to cut weight to help improve efficiency, but they haven't done so without making sacrifices. For example, 3/Y get some of the worst highway road noise ratings of comparably priced vehicles and have been reported to develop creeks early in their lives. Sure, the Tesla may get your to your destination 500 miles away 20 minutes faster than another EV, but you'll spend the entire 7 hours of drive time with louder road noise intrusion.If Tesla were to improve noise insulation, they'd have to give up some range. If they were to improve interior fit and finish, their R&D and manufacturing costs would go up.",0.001665633,0

It asked the court to rule that ""civic acknowledgments of religion in public life do not offend the establishment clause"" of the Constitution ""as long as they neither threaten the establishment of an official religion nor coerce participation in religious activities.""At the time, officials in the first Bush administration told reporters that the reason for intervening was a tactical decision to try to draw out Justice David H. Souter, then the court's newest member, and get him on the side of the administration, which was hoping eventually to change the approach to religion in public settings.In the end, the court voted 5 to 4 against the administration and upheld the lower court's decision. Among those in the majority were Justice Souter and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose seat Judge Roberts has been nominated to fill.Barry W. Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said Wednesday that Judge Roberts's participation in the case makes him ""unsuited for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.""

"“Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities” Modern translation from Voltaire 17651765: Certainement qui est en droit de vous rendre absurde, est en droit de vous rendre injusteTranslation 01: Certainly, whoever has the right to make you absurd has the right to make you unjustTranslation 02: Truly, whoever can make you look absurd can make you act unjustlyTranslation 03: Certainly anyone who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injusticesThe line above appeared within letter number eleven published in 1765 in Voltaire's work “Collection des Lettres sur les Miracles” (“Collection of Letters on Miracles”). A larger excerpt appears further below.Pertinent matches in English using the word “atrocities” began to appear by 1914. Voltaire usually received credit for these sayings, and they form a natural family although the precise phrasings and meanings vary. The following overview with dates shows the evolution:1914: As long as people continue to believe absurdities they will continue to commit atrocities (Spoken by a fictional version of Voltaire)1933: Men will continue to commit atrocities as long as they continue to believe absurdities (Described as “formula of Voltaire”)1936: Men will continue to commit atrocities as long as they continue to believe absurdities (Attributed to Voltaire)1937: If we believe absurdities, we shall commit atrocities (Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan)1944: Men will be brutal so long as they believe absurdities (Attributed to Voltaire)1946: People who believe in absurdities will commit atrocities (Attributed to a great thinker)1960: Certainly any one who has the power to make you believe absurdities has the power to make you commit injustices. (Translation of Voltaire by Norman L. Torrey)1963: Those who can persuade us to believe absurdities can make us commit atrocities (Described as a dictum of Voltaire by Norman L. Torrey)1977: Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities (Attributed to Voltaire)Trump and his cult ain't new. This shits been around forever.

Here is the argument being made by Grahams attorneys in their appeal to the Supreme Court. This was taken directly from the court filing. >Without a stay, Senator Lindsey Graham will soon be questioned by a local Georgia prosecutor and her ad hoc investigative body about his protected “Speech or Debate” related to the 2020 election. This will occur despite the Constitution's command that Senators “shall not be questioned” about “any Speech or Debate.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 6, cl. 1. It will occur in state court, without the consent of the federal government. And it will undisputedly center on Senator Graham's official acts— phone calls he made in the course of his official work, in the leadup to the critical vote under the Electoral Count Act. The district court's refusal to quash or at least stay this impermissible questioning—and the Eleventh Circuit's cursory acquiescence, while misquoting the “Speech or Debate Clause,” failing to invoke or apply the standard for a stay, and without so much as mentioning sovereign immunity—cries out for review. &#x200B;&#x200B;>Should the Supreme Court get involved when a senator gets a traffic ticketDo Senators have any privilege's that would prevent them from getting a traffic ticket?",0.000827098,0

Other countries have a Parliamentary system where ours in Constitutional. The final decision will always be binary, in nature, because of the mechanics of the system. We only have two ‘parties' because of math and game theory. If one ‘party' has 25% another has 25% and another has 50%, the ‘party' with 50% is always going to win. Forget traditional labels. US parties are really overarching mega groups. People should then look at caucuses as ‘parties.' It's all the end result of the USA being so huge with such a diverse citizenry. The states are like countries in the EU. We just need a reorganization of how we view our government. It's fine to see the problems with Madisonian democracy, but it's the best system we have. (If someone has a better one, please share it with the world) **In a democracy, you don't get everything you want.** That's the whole point. We have to learn to live together and compromise. There are things we all want to change, but ‘change' is too slow for some and too fast for others. Madisonian democracy gives ‘we the people' the freedom to participate in choosing our decision makers and guiding their choices. Democracy **IS** the freedom we are promised in the USA. If you don't vote, you're not participating in the core freedom the USA offers! History is filled with different versions of autocracy.

I am black and have been taught all the tactics used by both Democrats and Republicans on black people and I could easily pick things and say both sides or that it is too much for me or that I can't worry about X issues when I am worried about Y issues, but I learned that either way I was voting. Either way, I was helping a side. Not voting just meant I could tell myself and others a reason why I want to believe I am not part of the process.There is no quick or simple answer, especially not via social media or Reddit. It take a lot of time looking at yourself and a lot of information to finally realize that you are part of the game no matter what.Also keep in mind that can confusion or other issues that may keep you out of the process can and are applied to how people feel and act on a ton of other issues. For example, human rights, a person can easily feel confusion on LGBTQ issues and convince themselves and others to not engage, but those who don't engage are still engaging. The viewpoints and feelings people have are not just political ones. You don't turn on the ""political"" section of your brain and then turn it off. You act based on how you feel, how you were raised, what you believe or don't believe, what you care about and don't and a ton of other things people never tell others about.Anything you may ever care about will come down to someone else either caring and being active and engaged or not.

"You sure have a lack of empathy for someone who votes blue. I don't care if this is an assumption, don't give a shit if you think I'm being sarcastic, do not care how your small mind personal beliefs make you feel. I went to school for 8 years learning about just this. Emotions are caused by chemicals. You cannot turn them on or off on your own. You cannot choose how much to release. Voting does not affect how many chemicals are released. Maybe you might feel euphoric after you vote, but that doesn't have any affect of an outcome that might come years later. Complaining comes from different cocktails of emotions affect by various chemicals. Which still affects everyone differently. If you don't vote, these chemicals still exist. They don't just go away. You still have these emotions. Telling someone to suppress their emotions is extremely devastating to their mental health. Complaining can be a healthy way to releive some of these emotions. Complaining can also lead to emotions that are easier to control on your own.The hill your dying on is literally against human emotions affect by chemicals in your brain. Imagine telling a trans person to just not be trans. Imagine telling a homosexual to just not like the same sex anymore. It's not how it works. Your hill is antiscience.

I do, however, believe you **can** control your actions, unlike what you are suggesting. I am not saying you should suppress your **emotions,** I'm saying you should control your **actions,** in some situations.

"Summary of the article:Oz submitted research to the Association for Thoracic Surgery, wanting to explore cognitive ability on bypass surgery with or without a heart-lung machine. Due to standards at the time, the research was rejected for presentation and the AATS decided not to let him present research (and maybe publish) for two years. I am not sure the word ""ban"" is the best word, as it suggests more than a temporary exclusion of his studies, but okay.I can see both points. The use of the heart-lung machine is standard protocol and approved by various groups, as far as I can find out with limited searching. On the other hand, if the machine does cause further cognitive impairment, there is an argument to advance medical science to find a balance.But, I think this piece is only out there because [Fetterman looked horrible in the debate](https://twitter.com/IAPolls2022/status/1585091444041478145?s=20&t=PxQB66khnIqojMXJAzWWxA), so more about support for a candidate than news that would have been reported regardless.

Then after his abstract was accepted he incorporated more data (which again isn't unusual from the conferences I've presented at). I've never been told to only present on what's in my abstract and when I have more data available now. That would be very suspect to me because additional data can change the results, make them bigger, smaller, or even reverse the findings. You should be presenting the most accurate data, not out of date data just because it's what was in the abstract months ago. Perhaps other researchers can chime in on their professional meetings but this confuses me some from what's in the article but maybe I'm not getting it.

I'm talking about the old school surgeons and other practicing docs who decide to dip their feet into research to get one pub every few years.One of the studies I was on used blood sampling to estimate prevalence of covid19 in the hospital system's catchment area during the delta wave. They did an excellent job collecting the blood samples and processing them, but completely ignored uncertainty.We had two counties that had almost identical prevalence rates, but one was far better sampled. The results were something like county 1 = 20% (17%, 24%), and county 2 prevalence = 20% (1%, 73%).They lead doc did not understand that there was a fundamental difference between two counties.

"This is literally a Type I error, the ""more grave"" of the two conclusion errors in research and experimentation... and Oz did it on *purpose*.From the National Library of Medicine:> A Type I error occurs when in research when we reject the null hypothesis (*the null hypothesis is always that there is ""no effect"" from the Treatment on the samples, i.e. that the thing we're looking at doesn't create a Significant effect or differ Significantly* - *and that's the* significance level, *α, mind you! - from the rest of the population/data set that doesn't contain the ""Treatment""* - *emphasis mine*) and erroneously state that the study found Significant differences when there indeed was no difference. In other words, it is equivalent to saying that the groups or variables differ when, in fact, they do not or have false positives. Essentially it's the mistake of looking a two samples, one of which you did a ""Treatment"" to, and that one that *just so happened* to have a randomly higher percentage of effects/resulting conditions correlated to the Treatment you were testing leading you to erroneously conclude that your Treatment created a Significant effect, when in reality it was pure chance that your sample came out with those conditions in it and repeated experiments testing your Treatment again would be much less likely to give the same outcome, because in ""reality"" your Treatment did *not* have a statistically Significant impact to the sample.You can burn through this with **larger samples**... Dr. Oz knew this but pretended like his Treatment (use of heart-lung machines) case produced Significant effects with the too-small sample he had... he **lied** to *intentionally* make a Type I Error.In research this is unforgivable.

"Without seeing the data in question, I can't say for sure...*But*, 20 is not necessarily a small sample size. It just depends on what you're trying to measure and how confident you want to be.Typically, you're trying to accept or reject a hypothesis that two numbers are different, where those numbers are some sort of parameter related to the distribution of results in two different cases. Say, the mean. You want to see if two means are very different.Imagine the thing you are studying is height, and you want to show that people in their 20s are on average taller than people under 10.Even without doing a calculation, I'd guess you could pull that off with a couple of dozen observations.Or, say, mean temperature in Chicago in January versus July. That's another one where the means are so far apart *and the variances are not super huge*.That's the trick, really. The variance gives you your sense of scale. If you have some really noisy process, you can accurately measure a mean, but you need more observations to do it. With two noisy processes, if they have a lot of overlap, it takes longer to prove that they really are different.But with temperature in Chicago, or with height in adults vs. kids, you've got one number living way up high and the other living down low.While there's some swing in the temperature in Chicago in January, it is not going to get into July ranges very often, and when it does it won't stay there, so you don't need very many observations to tell that the average temperature in January is a lot lower.Contrast: weather in Chicago in March versus weather in Chicago in October. If those averages are different, they aren't *very* different, and your average October day could pass for a March day. You need a lot more data to determine if the two are different.I'm grossly oversimplifying the process of designing these experiments, of course, but the point is that *without context* you can't very well say whether 20 is a large sample or not.And that context must be the data, not just the field of study.You see a lot of people online who will point to the size of a study and say, ""See?

"Since I seriously doubt you'll make the effort to click the link to the affidavit provided in the article, here you go: “Events at the Pelosi House in San Francisco, California on October 28, 20229. On October 28, 2022, at 2:23 a.m., San Francisco Dispatch received a 9-1-1 call from Paul Pelosi (“Pelosi”) located at the Pelosi residence in San Francisco, California. Pelosi stated words to the effect of there is a male in the home and that the male is going to wait for Pelosi's wife. Pelosi further conveyed that he does not know who the male is. The male said his name is David.10. At 2:31 a.m., San Francisco Police Department (“SFPD”) Officer Colby Wilmes responded to the Pelosi residence, California and knocked on the front door. When the door was opened, Pelosi and DEPAPE were both holding a hammer with one hand and DEPAPE had his other hand holding onto Pelosi's forearm. Pelosi greeted the officers. The officers asked them what was going on. DEPAPE responded that everything was good. Officers then asked Pelosi and DEPAPE to drop the hammer.11. DEPAPE pulled the hammer from Pelosi's hand and swung the hammer, striking Pelosi in the head. Officers immediately went inside and were able to restrain DEPAPE. While officers were restraining DEPAPE, Pelosi appeared to be unconscious on the ground.Officers removed a cell phone, cash, clipper cards, and an unidentified card from DEPAPE's right shorts pocket. DEPAPE provided officers his first and last name. After officers asked DEPAPE if he had an ID on him, DEPAPE said it might be in his backpack on the back porch and later stated his backpack was near the broken glass. When officers removed DEPAPE from Pelosi's residence, police body worn camera footage showed a glass door that appeared to be laminated glass, broken near the door handle. San Francisco Police Department recovered zip ties in Pelosi's bedroom and in the hallway near the front door of the Pelosi residence. In addition, law enforcement searched DEPAPE's backpack at the Pelosi residence, and they found, among other things, a roll of tape, white rope, one hammer, one pair of rubber and cloth gloves, and a journal.Witness Statements12. SFPD Officer Colby Wilmes was able to interview a witness, Witness 1, who saw an individual in all black, carrying a large black bag on his back, walking near the Pelosi residence where Witness 1 was parked. Witness 1 was working private security at an address nearby. Witness 1 then heard what sounded like banging on either a door or car and then heard the sirens within a minute or two.13. Pelosi was interviewed by SFPD Officer Ariane Starks in the ambulance during transport to San Francisco General Hospital. Pelosi stated he had never seen DEPAPE before. Pelosi was asleep when DEPAPE came into Pelosi's bedroom and stated he wanted to talk to “Nancy.” When Pelosi told him that Nancy was not there, DEPAPE stated that he would sit and wait. Pelosi stated that his wife would not be home for several days and then DEPAPE reiterated that he would wait. Pelosi was able to go into the bathroom which is when he was able to call 9- 1-1. Pelosi stated that when the officers arrived, that was when DEPAPE struck him with the hammer.14. In a subsequent interview with law enforcement officers on October 30, 2022, Paul Pelosi stated that DEPAPE had a hammer with him during the events described above at the Pelosi residence. Further, the hammer did not belong to the Pelosi family.DEPAPE'S Interview on October 28, 2022:15. In a Mirandized and recorded interview of DEPAPE by San Francisco Police Department Officers, DEPAPE provided the following information:a. DEPAPE stated that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her. If Nancy were to tell DEPAPE the “truth,” he would let her go, and if she “lied,” he was going to break “her kneecaps.” DEPAPE was certain that Nancy would not have told the “truth.” In the course of the interview, DEPAPE articulated he viewed Nancy as the “leader of the pack” of lies told by the Democratic Party. DEPAPE also later explained that by breaking Nancy's kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress, which would show other Members of Congress there were consequences to actions. DEPAPE also explained generally that he wanted to use Nancy to lure another individual to DEPAPE.b. DEPAPE stated that he broke into the house through a glass door, which was a difficult task that required the use of a hammer. DEPAPE stated that Pelosi was in bed and appeared surprised by DEPAPE. DEPAPE told Pelosi to wake up. DEPAPE told Pelosi that he was looking for Nancy. Pelosi responded that she was not present. Pelosi asked how they could resolve the situation, and what DEPAPE wanted to do. DEPAPE stated he wanted to tie Pelosi up so that DEPAPE could go to sleep as he was tired from having had to carry a backpack to the Pelosi residence. Around this time, according to DEPAPE, DEPAPE started taking out twist ties from his pocket so that he could restrain Pelosi. Pelosi moved towards another part of the house, but DEPAPE stopped him and together they went back into the bedroom.c. While talking with each other, Pelosi went into a bathroom, where Pelosi grabbed a phone to call 9-1-1. DEPAPE stated he felt like Pelosi's actions compelled him to respond.d. DEPAPE remembered thinking that there was no way the police were going to forget about the phone call. DEPAPE explained that he did not leave after Pelosi's call to 9-1-1 because, much like the American founding fathers with the British, he was fighting against tyranny without the option of surrender. DEPAPE reiterated this sentiment elsewhere in the interview.e. DEPAPE stated that they went downstairs to the front door. The police arrived and knocked on the door, and Pelosi ran over and opened it. Pelosi grabbed onto DEPAPE's hammer, which was in DEPAPE's hand. At this point in the interview, DEPAPE repeated that DEPAPE did not plan to surrender and that he would go “through” Pelosi.f. DEPAPE stated that he pulled the hammer away from Pelosi and swung the hammer towards Pelosi. DEPAPE explained that Pelosi's actions resulted in Pelosi “taking the punishment instead”",0.001003161,0

The die-hard Trump supporters will die hard, either at the hands of Trump's own secret police, or be drafted into the army to fight in genocidal wars of conquest.

Use violent rhetoric to radicalize and polarize the population.2. Hark back to a better time (even if it wasn't really better). 3. Demand national dignity (Make Germany great again).4. Push race hatred against Gypsies, Jews, Slavs (Poles, Ukrainians, Russians), Africans, and eventually insist all non-Germans must be genocidally eliminated, killed.5. After gaining the dictatorship, kill off the old guard in your own party: anyone who can say, ""I was here before Hitler (or Trump)."" Replace them with a new guard that you have elevated yourself, that owe total loyalty to the dictator.6. Start wars of aggression to distract and mobilize the masses at home. Fill them with patriotic fervor.The USA has a lot of safeguards built into the government; checks and balances, so Trump did not get past step 4. Unfortunately, he and Putin made a lot of progress in their takeover of the USA.

"> it's actually everything at once, whatever is convenient at the momentThinking back to when I was a conservative, I'm struck by the focus they have on having ""an answer"" to a question or situation, rather than finding the correct answer. They just need something to say that makes them look good. Their only focus is winning the argument, rather than learning or discovering anything. I was raised as a homeschool kid, so I was the testing-ground for the larger conservative hysteria that we have seen unfold since Newt Gingrich. I was trained to feel like I won when the other person quit. As long as I had the last word then it was a victory. This was >20 years ago, so it's remarkable to see that entire process embraced on a larger scale. The really unnerving thing is if my parents had their way, I would be deep into raising my own children to be crazy carbon copies of my contentious conservative self.

And ultimately evidence doesn't show that the election was rigged in Georgia. The machines are backed up by paper ballots. Three times it was recounted and it was found the faults were valid. Some votes were added for Trump. But if after three recounts they couldn't prove fraud then what reason do we have to believe there was.

VICE News obtained an audio recording of Karamo's appearance on a QAnon podcast called Redpill News just weeks after the 2020 election, where she said that abortion is “child sacrifice” and boosted false claims that the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capital on January 6, 2021, were “Antifa posing as Trump supporters.”In the 2020 interview, Karamo said that abortion is a “religious ritual” by “the satanic temple” and that people take the “baby body parts” and “sell the organs.” This is one of QAnon's most extreme beliefs, that members of the global elite traffic children in order to harvest a chemical from their blood that they use to live longer.Karamo became a minor star within the GOP after she claimed to have witnessed voter fraud during the 2020 election while acting as a poll challenger in Detroit.

"Environmental scientist here!We call this bioaccumulation. It's a phenomenon with many toxins. For instance, fat-soluble substances can be stored in adipose tissue for a length of time to little effect, but weight loss can then release these stored chemicals, leading to harm. This is frequently a mechanism of mobility for more ""complex"" organic pollutants. Things like metals (i.e., lead) nefariously are bioaccumulated in the body in other ways. Certain hazardous metals can mimic harmless ones. For instance, atomic testing created radioactive strontium which can behave identically to the element calcium; this led to concerns about radioactive cows' milk and ultimately incorporation of radioisotopes into childrens' growing skeletons. This concern, in part, was what led to the above ground atomic test ban treaty. Harmful metals sneak into certain biochemical reactions by behaving like harmless ones. Lead is one of several notorious members on this list.

"Chief Justice Roberts is supposedly concerned about the precipitous drop in the American people's regard for our highest court, but Roberts is also still on the Republican base's shit list for being the deciding vote to preserve Obamacare. Roberts will bare minimum delay the multiple courts-ordered release of Trump's taxes until after next Tuesday's election…or if the votes are there, acquiesce in overturning the lower courts and allow Trump to keep his obviously embarrassing or misdeed-laden taxes secret from the American people as he ponders a third run for President.A then-narrow conservative majority on the Rehnquist Supreme Court badly stained the court's integrity by handing the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush in an opinion so clearly designed to reach a specific partisan goal that it was designated as not constituting precedent for any other case. The Roberts Court on June 24, 2022, in among the most shoddily rationalized decisions in the court's 233-year history, trashed 49 1/2 years of judicial precedent and eradicated women's constitutionally guaranteed reproductive freedom. This draconian assault on women's rights constitutes a blank check for forced-birth fanatic Republican-run states, 26 in all, to effectively ban abortions under any circumstances, via laws that border on fetus fetishism by compelling pre-teen girls raped by male relatives to carry the pregnancy to term despite the girls' bodies not being sufficiently developed to safely handle childbirth. In many more states, the Supreme Court ruling has put doctors at risk of losing their licenses or even going to jail if they appropriately treat women with ectopic pregnancies or dare to put the life or physical/emotional health of a woman ahead of delivering a dead fetus. Nothing can fully restore the court's lost legitimacy but if the court allows Trump— the only president in the nearly 50 years since releasing income tax returns became accepted practice to refuse to do so—to get away with stonewalling the American people for over six years on this matter, the Supreme Court will affirm itself to be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Republican Party, which itself is owned lock, stock and barrel by Trump himself.",0.017917732,0

And just repeal will only end up ending all social media and every single forum and every singly user generated content website on the internet.

"Human behavior algorithms need to have strict regulations is really the underlying cause. Nobody is saying Imgur needs strict regulation but Youtube/Facebook that has an active ability to shape the content users see need to be regulated for the following reasons1) To limit radicalization and that goes both ways. Extremism content should be allowed to be posted if the platform desires however there needs to be strict controls about how much pressure the AI pushes people towards extreme content. A solution is that heavily biased news that is either blatantly false or uses highly inflmmatory language (e.g. known derogatory language towards certain political beliefs that I cannot mention here due to good taste and reddit auto mods) should have their weights greatly reduced. 2) Anything with focused content on minors should not feed into the 'recommended' lists. So if you want to search for Nastya directly you can find it, but watching one unboxing video shouldn't suddenly fill your feed with 8yrs olds. This is a known issue where a blogger noted a ""7 degrees to creepy pseudo-pedophilic videos"" and once you watch some of those it just keeps feeding you video after video of young children in skin tight outfits doing yoga or stretches. Really disiturbing stuff. Also de-incentivizing minor content across the board helps clean up all these horrific ""parents force kids into video"" borderline child abuse issues. The entertainment industry is HIGHLY regulated when it comes to child actors and youtube is a huge loophole with those regulations.3) Regulate political ads to the same degree as the rest of the media space.4) Oversight into algorithms focused on increasing interaction rates. Algorithms are being trained to literally hack your brain and make you a slave to watch endless hours of content because unlike television you can't get real time feedback on millions of users every second to accelerate training. Social Media addiction needs to be treated the same as gambling addiction where social media companies need to help fund recovery programs.This might sound invasive of draconian but the truth is the AI is having its way with our nation tech companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves. Almost no industry has successfully done self-regulation until they've been around for a couple hundred years or so. As a part of this the government needs to get ahead of the curve now and fund a Department of Artificial Intelligence that just like the FEC or FDA staffs AI experts who can provide oversights into these AIs.For example some research institute releases an AI that can swap faces and now the internet is full of celebrity deep fake videos. Should something like that have been released into the market? Should a public released model have built in stopgaps to prevent things like pornography or violent imagery from being generated? I can't think of a single use case why the general public needs a deep fake generator and, in theory, a research institute could get access to an unrestricted model for specific purposes but again you can stick embedded watermarks or whatever so if it ever gets released you can track and fine the leaker into oblivion.",0.008276513,0

The growth of talk radio during the 90's almost exclusively was far-right in it's ideology, and laid the groundwork for the current fascist movement.

"It took a while to figure out just why Jr's post along with all of the rest of their horrifically inappropriate comments bothered me so badly but I just figured it out and it lines up so perfectly with the GOP's biggest and most cherished core value, dishonorFamilies are on the tableIt all makes sense if you consider the 30k verified lies, the vile hatred pushed so unethically by virtually all of them lead of course by their state media flagship fox news, and the wilfull ignorance of their leaderships reactions to covid, Russian alliance, and the attempted overthrow of a free and fair election. Dishonor is behind all forms of fascism and this is what the GOP stands for. The next step behind this very disturbing dehumanization, is barbarism, and I'm reminded of that scene in Schindlers list where the colonel starts plinking off Jews in the concentration camp half dressed from the balcony of his villa with great satisfaction. I was struck with the exact same disdain towards the complete lack of empathy towards fellow human beings when reading yesterdays tweet from a former ""presidents"" son. It all lines up, it all makes sense, and they are all on board with this hatred of their fellow Americans and the representation they choose. These people are irreparably sick and we really are at a crossroads here. If republicans win fair and square, then I really don't want anything to do with this country anymore because I don't even want to breathe the same air with those who think it's ok to ""kneecap"" political rivals. And if they don't win fair and square but steal the midterms anyway... well, I guess we adapt and play by the same rules then.

""They just don't know it comes from Nazis, they are being misled.""Why does it appeal to them in the first place? Why does all it take is to hide the word Nazi to get them goose stepping? Because they know the word Nazi is bad. But they love what the Nazis have to say.

Many Republicans would rather elect to do nothing and continue obstructing and thwarting all efforts from Democrats to pass any meaningful legislation or policy that may even attempt to address this country's economic issues. Yet their voters eat it up, it doesn't matter how irrational, insincere or presumptuous their claims may be, as long as they can blame it all on the Biden administration, their voters will mindlessly lap it up. Tax and spending cuts, along with measures and policies that maintain or increase oil production, will benefit the rich, the big corporations, the special interest groups and Republican donors more than anybody else in the end. Not to mention how the GOP has expressed its interest in cutting spending to programs like Medicare and Social Security, with the intention to blame it on Democrats no less.In the end, it's just another game of partisan politics, some representatives really are that delusional and naive, and blame things like inflation solely on the Biden administration, but there are likely quite a few Republicans who understand that it's just politically advantageous to pander to ignorant voters with inflammatory rhetoric.And when these Republicans do have power, they'll do what they always do, cater to the rich, their wealthy donors, special interests and profiteers while disguising it as a godsend to the working and middle class, justifying their measures with narratives and rhetoric that vilifies ""the radical left"".",0.020407567,0

Why does the author act surprised? “Eerily similar responses”? You know what's an eerily similar response the media's constant “surprise” at the same old coordinated tactics the Republican Party has been executing for a decade. Using the same talking points is not eerie. What's eerie is voters accepting the same talking points from candidates who aren't speaking to their actual constituents.

">Americans reputedly have short attention spans. But their decisions have long fuses. People vote for reasons that may be quite contingent, even temporary or incidental, but that seem compelling in the moment—with effects that detonate long afterward.>>Republicans won a remarkable nine seats in the U.S. Senate in the elections of 2014. That sweep empowered Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to block President Barack Obama's 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court. McConnell held the seat open until a Republican president could fill it—setting us on the path to a conservative supermajority on the Court that this year reached a 6–3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.>>What enabled the Republicans' extraordinary showing in those midterms? Good evidence suggests that the GOP owed its sweep to an event almost forgotten in this decade that is now so defined by the COVID-19 pandemic: the panic in the fall of 2014 over the Ebola virus.>>The first American Ebola case was reported on September 30: A Liberian man sick with the disease had flown into the U.S. seeking care. Though uninsured, he received treatment at a Dallas hospital but died a week later—having infected two of his American nurses. (They recovered.) It was exactly the kind of story, freighted with fear and resentment, to supercharge Republican voters.>>...>>When political scientists studied the numbers more closely after the 2014 vote, they found that Ebola fears correlated closely with an increase in support for Republican candidates. Given that 2014 was a low-turnout election (the lowest since 1942), an issue such as this—that energized Republicans without much affecting Democrats—could convert the governing party's usual midterm losses into a wave election.>>The episode has largely slipped from public memory because the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was snuffed out the next year by effective international public-health intervention, and the weeks of terrifying coverage by CNN and local news stations vanished into the video archives. But the political legacy of that terror lingers: The Republican voters' enthusiasm that year lit the fuse that led to the demolition eight years later of a half-century-old abortion precedent.>>The lesson for the 2022 cycle is that the issues that seemed most salient as voters went to the polls will probably be long-forgotten in a few years' time—but their choice will have had a huge bearing on what becomes of the United States. Voters can't be expected to apprehend the longer-term consequences of the votes they cast. But their votes have consequences.>>Ahead of this year's elections, voters seem motivated above all by cost-of-living issues, with additional concerns about crime and illegal immigration, and possibly cultural issues such as transgender teen athletes seeking to play in girls' sports leagues, also factoring in. Voters are not much preoccupied by threats to democracy.Getting the electorate out to vote will be one of the main challenges of this election.

That wouldn't work now for most of the GQP, because on any significant issue conservative media creates an alternate reality with its own facts, and millions have been trained to believe what conservative media tells them and reject the mainstream media coverage even when there's ample evidence *that they could check for themselves* to show them that the conservative media spin is maliciously dishonest.The differences aren't over principles and priorities now, because tens of millions of conservatives have broken ideas about how knowledge works, how to think about evidence and plausibility, when and how to be skeptical, what it means to research a topic, etc.",0.000870453,0

Also, 100% of Maricopa county residents vote by mail during off-election years for things like school board elections, override bonds for police/schools, and other local funding.

In any case, working up any kind of defense takes time and the defendant is only given basic discovery at arraignment. Your assessment is correct. This will not likely lead to a jury trial based on the evidence unless the prosecutor only offers maximum sentencing for all the charged crimes. Given the high profile nature of the case, that might end up being what happens. This defendant has absolutely zero leverage. In a situation like that, a jury trial in that kind of situation is called a slow plea. So, there is a jury trial where the prosecutor walks the case through and he gets convicted. There are all of the witnesses for sentencing. He ends up with the maximum. But, if there was any kind of error in the trial, he can appeal.

While I agree that consequences should exist and consequences feel like they're lower than they should be… it feels like a massive logically fallacy to think that punishing people severely makes the issue go away. It hasn't done that for drugs. It hasn't done that for stealing or rape. These issues are personality based and personalities don't disappear when you sufficiently punish some group of people. Look at the rise of neo nazis in Germany. It's not for want of punishing or trying to prevent presence of their symbols. It's because some personalities seek out ways to be assholes and the universe provides.Feels like sometimes the call for “harsher punishment!” mirrors the republican call to do that. But we rightfully point out when they do it that it doesn't fix the problem. The solution is more research into how to stabilize societies when dark triad personalities going amok.

">Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one's prejudgment simply need not be believed – in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical – and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one.

I'm an Iranian-American who isn't religious. The usage of Islamophobia isn't specific to a political party in this country. The Republicans are worse because they will attack us directly.

There's lots of techniques you can use that aren't that for keeping the dark triad of personalities more well contained but it's super rare when we see them. You can spot them right away though, they're the interviews where we applaud the reporter sticking to an item even when it's uncomfortable, they're the reporters who see through a sound bite and don't take the attention seeking bait. We ALL need training in THAT if we want to stop the incursion of those darker personality traits. Otherwise ANY of all that “preparing for the worst” is gonna be useless because in “the worst” those darker personalities have historically tended to rule UNTIL people relearn how to deal with them or you get a massive amount of violence and death.

"No, I think we might be speaking at odds. Education and critical thinking do NOT teach you how to deal with sociopathic or authoritarian personalities. There isn't any class in high school or college unless you're maybe taking certain psychology courses. It's an entirely distinct set of life skills, one you would get, for example, by living with people with extreme narcissistic personality disorders or one you get if you manage to live at equal states with people with dark triad personalities (although that's super rare).However I think we may be also speaking at different expectations. You seem far more ready for the “society crumbles” portion of the issue than I think is necessarily useful in the discussion. I'm not discrediting that that isn't something people need to be aware of but with respect to actually solving the problem it tends to presume the problem is already unsolvable and leaps to “how do we survive now”.The problem with that mentality is it's one countries tend to stay in once they enter it. Those personalities and their tendency to grasp for power when options for power are present don't go away. You can't “kill them all with a gun” when new people with that personality keep getting born. You need a plan for getting OUT of that mentality or else you've given up for any human lifespan foreseeable future. Even if you're all buffed up and know how to use a weapon.",0.004839961,0

Those things you mention were things the Nazi's did to assert their power, but weren't general ideological identities. They were the results of those ideologies.

We might have to just work with what we have an play it by ear.The thing that has stopped most authoritarian countries from maintaining such a status quo so far is violent insurrection, invasion, coups and military or governmental collapse.

I kept expecting you to correct me with something I overlooked since I obviously didn't live through that period of history.Here's the point to make about not calling Republicans ""Nazis."" Some Republicans *are* Nazis, unabashedly. Some Democrats *are* Nazis - but abashedly. When you label the opposition to *characterize* their ideas instead of factually discrediting them without such characterizations, you diminish the gravity of the situation. Because you're not actually pointing to government agents sending people to concentration camps. To every *rational* person it looks like hyperbole intended to drive an emotional response instead of building consensus on the best way forward.At the same time, everyone who knows history can see the *parallels* between Republicans and historical fascists. Focus on the actual ideas and policies instead of labeling the opposition to convince others how upset they need to be emotionally.",0.023426974,0
"Violent insurrection only worked in so far as it did because prior to it there was a well codified and prepared response to how to get out of that violent period. Whenever violently solving the current problem is brought up I always ask what the plan is for getting out of it into the next thing and there's always crickets. That's a bad sign. Historically that's when you get your charismatic revolutionaries who don't know how to govern after they're done killing the baddies and turn to the same authoritarian tactics to keep the trains running on time.What I mean is that there are understandings about human nature and how certain personalities work that make social media engineering so effective. It's those takeaways that I'm proposing we need to double down on to help with solving our current problem. There's a bunch of people who've made a very profitable career of exploiting those personality traits and patterns for bad stuff both in social media and in using those techniques outside it in live ads, in how they talk about certain issues, etc. the stuff Cambridge analytica charged republicans a buttload to distill. there's absolutely no reason the same underlying techniques and understandings of human nature can't be used for better purposes. We just haven't really spent much time in the pursuit of what opportunities might be there.",0.00226734,0
"Social media engineering is so effective because it predominantly preys upon human insecurities and predilicition for conformity. People are no longer taught to spot propaganda in this country and the effectiveness of social media in it's dissemination is undeniable. I agree that we could learn a lot from the underlying factors at play, but I have little faith in our ability to use it for ethical purposes.Revolution isn't what's needed, but we need to engage with people on a real, individual level. Much of the right's messaging is about dehumanization and the inherent weakness and meekness of the political left. And it has been very, very effective. Everyone in this country needs to understand that they are not all that different and controlling the narrative on social media is not going to achieve that.",0.000668128,0
The use of how humans are engineered to work doesn't have to be just non-ethical. Social shaming can be used to ostracize minority groups and non-conforming individuals. Social shaming can also be used productively in smaller cultures to stop undesirable behavior like sleeping around or stealing. We can use humor to ridicule people in a bad way or we can use it to reduce the power of despots by making them seem ridiculous. Arguably the belief that it can only be used for unethical means means there probably is pretty wide open fields of research we haven't done that might be productive.,0.003578573,0
